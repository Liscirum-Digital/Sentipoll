# Turbaerit
Tubaerit is an open source tool used to collect data from local groups.

After creating a survey, users can access a simple web interface and provide measured data.
The collected information is presented as a diagram, but can also be exported to a CSV-file.

The project was developed by Liscirum Digital for CG.
