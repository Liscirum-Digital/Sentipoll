# Turbaerit
Tubaerit is an open source tool used to collect data from local groups.

After creating a survey, users can access a simple web interface and provide measured data.
The collected information is presented as a diagram, but can also be exported to a CSV-file.

The project is being developed by Liscirum Digital for CG.

## Use case: interactive teaching
Turbaerit is being developed primarily for use in science lessons. The results of conducted experiments can be collected and visualised, thus making the data easier to analyse. The project can make lessons more interactive and enables collaboration to obtain large data sets. Turbaerit is also equipped with several security measures to prevent trolling and distortion of the results.

## Setup
Download the project and run `setup.sh`. A development server should start.  
Production deployment has not been enabled yet, but will be developed for Apache web servers.
